The scripts to run the simulations of 1% CO2 increase for the E3SM ECA configuration.

- 1pctco2       full simulations in which the rising [CO2] has effects on both radiation and biogeochemistry
- 1pctco2bgc     bgc simulations in which the rising [CO2] only have effects on biogeochemistry
- 1pctco2ctl     ctl simulations in which the [CO2] is kept the same level in 1850 and it has effects on both radiation and biogeochemistry
